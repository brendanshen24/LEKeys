# LEKeys
NextJS, expressJS and NodeJS based piano tutor!

## Build using
`pnpm install; node demoServer.js # start the server`

`cd lekey; pnpm install; pnpm run dev # start the client`

## Inspiration
As kids, we hated our piano lessons, yet loved playing Piano Tiles. Taking inspiration from the infamous game, we created _LEKeys_  
## What it does
LEKeys is a piano with illuminated keys that also links to a web app that guides users through the learning journey, making learning piano more affordable and fun!
## How we built it
For our hardware, we inserted LED lights under the keyboard keys. We used Arduino Uno to link the LED lights to nodejs. 
## Challenges we ran into
We had to make sure that the LED lights fit under the keys while ensuring that those keys were still playable. Our team made a lot of adjustments to the keyboard, and we were able to get it to work! 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were able to pump out a clean-looking UI and highly responsive hardware. 
## What we learned
We learned how to use Arduino and nodejs, as well as come up with ideas and risk mitigations 
## What's next for LEKeys
We are looking at importing a music sheet database to teach users to learn how to sightread. We are also thinking of implementing learning trees.
